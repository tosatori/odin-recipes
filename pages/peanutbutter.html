        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>You need a jar of peanutbutter, preferably homemade, but I'm too lazy to type out the whole process, so you gotta figure out by yourself how to do this. Store bought will work just fine. Open jar and cram the delicious stuff into your mouth and enjoy. Repeat until satisfied.</p>
