# odin-recipes
A simple website with recipes. It serves as an exercise to learn the basic concepts of web development.
It's the first project from the Foundations track of the "The Odin Project".

By making this website I learned about basic html-stuff like headings, paragraphs, adding text, adding images, link to other pages, folder structure, how to use git, how to write commit messages, how to push the work to the GitHub repository.
